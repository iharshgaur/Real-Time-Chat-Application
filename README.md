# Real-time chat application ðŸ’¬

Few months back I was wondering if I could create a chat application with minimal things. A chat application that is not too complicated but also works like charm. This chat application allows users to create private chatrooms and then chat with their friends by creating rooms. To make it more user friendly emojies can also be added using the keyboard shortcuts.

# Technology Stack Used ðŸ’»

In this project I have used the following tech stack.
